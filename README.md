CMSapp
---

This is a simple CMS application created to explore and learn how CMSes are built along with little MVC magic :)
It has an administrator and a few users, with the administrator having control over addition,updation and deletion of users.
The usernames and passwords have been stored in an excel file for reference, as a password function has been applied to store the passwords in the mysql DB.
